# Detailed Change Log: CL-0011

Back to main log: [docs/commit-log.md](../commit-log.md)

## Commit Summary
Switch commit logs to sequential IDs.

## Why
Avoid infinite follow-up commits caused by hash-based logging while preserving sequential learning notes.

## What Changed
- Renamed detailed logs to sequential ID filenames.
- Updated all links and entries in the main commit log.

## How (Implementation Details)
- Rewrote the main log to use CL- IDs and regenerated detailed files with consistent templates.
- Removed hash-based references to keep the process self-contained.

## Files Touched
- `docs/commit-log.md`
- `docs/change-log-detailed/`
