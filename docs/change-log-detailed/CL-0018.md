## Commit Summary
Add Kinesis polling for partner ingestion.

## Why
Process partner/edge ingestion events separately from Kafka while reusing the same scoring pipeline.

## What Changed
- Added Kinesis polling in the processing worker.
- Added shared queue publisher for Kinesis and Kafka paths.
- Wired Kinesis configuration and Kubernetes environment variables.
- Updated README pipeline description.

## How (Implementation Details)
- Added `KinesisIngestPoller` with scheduled polling, shard iteration, and record parsing.
- Added `PartnerQueuePublisher` to centralize RabbitMQ publishing.
- Extended `ProcessingConfig` with a Kinesis client and updated application configuration.
- Updated `processing-worker` dependencies to include the AWS Kinesis SDK.
