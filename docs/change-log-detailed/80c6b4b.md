# Detailed Change Log: 80c6b4b

Back to main log: [docs/commit-log.md](../commit-log.md)

## Commit Summary
Initialize DataTrust360 multi-module scaffold.

## Why
Establish the foundational structure and core services so later work can focus on security, pipelines, storage, and observability without rework.

## What Changed
- Added Maven parent and module layout.
- Added service skeletons for auth gateway, REST ingest, gRPC ingest, processing worker, and storage service.
- Added initial security configuration with public endpoints and OAuth2/SAML placeholders.
- Added Kafka/Kinesis publishing, RabbitMQ worker wiring, and gRPC proto.
- Added SQL (JPA) and NoSQL (MongoDB) data models and storage APIs.
- Added UML diagrams, OpenAI insights doc, tests, and Docker/K8s/Prometheus/Grafana assets.

## How (Implementation Details)
- Created module directories and POMs to define build boundaries and dependencies.
- Implemented Spring Boot entry points and baseline controllers/services for each module.
- Configured Spring Security with public + RBAC and placeholders for OAuth2/SAML.
- Wired ingestion services to Kafka and Kinesis clients with topic/stream config.
- Implemented gRPC service for bulk ingestion with proto definitions.
- Added RabbitMQ queue config and worker to process async scoring jobs.
- Created JPA entities and Mongo document models for SQL/NoSQL storage.
- Added starter docs (README, UML) and infrastructure files for local ops.

## Files Touched (High-Level)
- Root `pom.xml` and module `pom.xml` files
- `auth-gateway/`, `ingest-rest/`, `ingest-grpc/`, `processing-worker/`, `storage-service/`
- `docs/`, `docker/`, `k8s/`
